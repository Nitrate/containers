Nitrate is a full-featured test plan, test run and test case
management system, which is written in Python and Django web
framework.

## Tags

`latest` is applied to the image built from latest `develop`
branch. It can also be called the development version of Nitrate.

For a regular release, a specific version like `4.10` is applied to
the image.

To list all tags including previous versions, please move to
[Tags](https://quay.io/repository/nitrate/nitrate?tab=tags) page.

To list tags from command line:

- `make images-overview [version=<version>]`

## Worker Image

Nitrate supports to schedule asynchronous tasks as Celery
tasks. Hence, worker container is required to receive the tasks from a
broker and execute them. There is a built worker image in the
[nitrate-worker](https://quay.io/repository/nitrate/nitrate-worker?tab=tags)
repository. If you need the asynchronous functionality, the worker
image could be deployed with this Web image together in your
environment.

The worker image has same tag scheme. Refer to the above [Tags](#tags)
section.

When making a new release of Nitrate, both this Web and the worker
image are built and published to the repositories individually.

**Hint**: You can try the worker image with the [container-compose.yml](https://github.com/Nitrate/Nitrate/blob/master/container-compose.yml).

## Usage

This image only has installed Nitrate Web application. If persistent
data storage is required, a well-configured database container, like
MariaDB or PostgreSQL, has to be deployed as well.

In practice, there are several ways to run the container.

### Run locally

Nitrate is able to run locally by either `docker` or `podman` and be
linked to a database container:

```
podman run -p 80:80 -t quay.io/nitrate/nitrate:4.12
```

Following various environment variables can be set to initialize the
container to connect the database container.

To launch the whole environment quickly in an easier way than running
podman command, you can use the `podman-compose` or `docker-compose`
to up containers.

```
podman-compose up
```

Nitrate source code provides the
[container-compose.yml](https://github.com/Nitrate/Nitrate/blob/master/container-compose.yml)
to up Nitrate locally. **Note that**, please do not use it as a
production environment.

### Run in the cloud

To deploy Nitrate in the could, please refer to the documentation of
the specific cloud product.

In case you are using the OpenShift, please move to
https://docs.openshift.com/.

In whatever the way you run the Nitrate in the cloud, the environment
variables and volumes described following may be used to customize the
use and maintenance.

## Environment Variables

### `NITRATE_DB_*`

There are a few of environment variables you can set to configure for
the database connection from the Web container.

- `NITRATE_DB_ENGINE`: set to use which database backend. It could be
`mysql` or `pgsql`.

- `NITRATE_DB_NAME`: the database name to connect. This is
optional. Default to `nitrate`.

- `NITRATE_DB_USER`: the username used to connect to database. This is
optional.  Default to `nitrate`.

- `NITRATE_DB_PASSWORD`: the password used with username together to
connect a database. This is optional. Without passing a password,
empty password is used to connect the database. Hence, it depends on
the authentication configuration in database server side whether to
allow logging in with empty password.

- `NITRATE_DB_HOST`: the host name of database server. This is
optional. Default to connect to localhost. Generally, this variable
must be set at least.

- `NITRATE_DB_PORT`: the database port to connect. This is
optional. Default to the database default port. Please consult the
concrete database product documentation. Generally, default port of
MySQL and MariaDB is `3306`, and PostgreSQL's is `5432`.

### `NITRATE_MIGRATE_DB`

This variable is optional and allows to run the database migrations
during launching the container. This is useful particularly for the
first time to run Nitrate.

### `NITRATE_SUPERUSER_USERNAME`, `NITRATE_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`, `NITRATE_SUPERUSER_EMAIL`

These variables are optional to create a superuser account during
launching the container. All of these three variables must be set at
the same time. This is helpful for the first time to run Nitrate in
order to login quickly just after the container is launched
successfully.

### `NITRATE_SET_DEFAULT_PERMS`

This variable is optional to create the default groups and grant
permissions to them.

## Volumes

### `/var/log/httpd`

The directory to store the httpd log files. Ensure the write
permission is granted properly.

### `/var/nitrate/uploads`

The directory to store the uploaded attachment files. Ensure the write
permission is granted properly.

### `/nitrate-config`

The directory holding the custom config module. Mount this volume when
default settings have to be customized. For most of the cases running
Nitrate in your cloud environment, customization should be
required. To customize the settings, create a Python module
`nitrate_custom_conf.py` inside a directory which will be mounted to
this container volume.

## Manual operations

Several environment variables mentioned above are optional to be
set. Without setting those variables, administrator is able to do the
equivalent operations manually.

### Run database migrations

```bash
podman exec -it [container name] django-admin migrate
```

### Create a superuser

```bash
podman exec -it [container name] django-admin createsuperuser
```

### Create default groups with permissions

```bash
podman exec -it [container name] django-admin setdefaultperms
```
